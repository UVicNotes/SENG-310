A conceptual model is a description of the proposed system in terms of a set of integrated ideas and concepts about what it should do, behave and look like, that will be understandable by the users in the manner intended. A good conceptual model allows users to \npredict the effects of their actions\n.  \n\n\nThe \nsystem image\n describes the physical structure that has been built \ni.e. the physical characteristics of the application itself (look and feel).\n\nThe designer communicates their design model using the system image and any documentation that goes with it. The \nuser's conceptual model\n is developed through interacting with the system and by reading any accompanying documentation.  \n\n\nModels Based on Activities\n\n\nGiving Instructions\n\n\n\n\nUser's give instructions to computer (e.g. tell time, save a file)\n\n\nBenefit is that is provides quick and efficient interations\n\n\nGood for repetitive kinds of actions\n\n\n\n\nConversing\n\n\n\n\nUnderlying model of having a conversation with another human\n\n\nRange of simple voice recognition menu-driven systems to complex dialogues (e.g. Clippy, Siri)\n\n\nAllows users, especially novices to ineract in a comfortable way that's more familiar\n\n\n\n\nManipulating\n\n\n\n\nDraging, selecting, opening, closing and zooming\n\n\nExploit user's knowledge of how they move and manipulate in the physical world\n\n\nContinuous representation of objects and actions of interest\n\n\nPhysical actions and button pressing instead of issuing commands with complex syntax\n\n\nRapid reversible actions with immediate feedback on object of interest\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\n\n\nNovices can learn the basic functionality quickly\n\n\nExperienced users can work extremely rapidly to carry out a wide range of tasks, even defining new functions \n\n\nIntermittent users can retain operational concepts over time\n\n\nError messages rarely needed\n\n\nUsers can immediately see if their actions are furthering their goals and if not do something else\n\n\nUsers experience less anxiety\n\n\nUsers gain confidence and mastery and feel in control\n\n\n\n\nDisadvantages\n\n\n\n\nSome people take the metaphor of direct manipulation too literally\n\n\nNot all tasks can be described by objects and not all actions can be done directly\n\n\nSome tasks are better achieved through delegating (e.g. spell checking)\n\n\nCan become screen space \u2018gobblers\u2019\n\n\nMoving a mouse around the screen can be slower than pressing function keys to do same actions\n\n\n\n\nExploring\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to how people browse information with existing media (e.g. newspapers, magazines, libraries, pamphlets)\n\n\nInformation is structured to allow flexibility in way user is able to search for information\n\n\n\n\nWhich Conceptual Model is Best\n\n\nDirect manipulation is good for \u2018doing\u2019 types of tasks, e.g. designing, drawing, flying, driving, sizing windows.\n\nIssuing instructions is good for repetitive tasks (e.g. spell-checking, file management).\n\nHaving a conversation is good for children, computer-phobic, disabled users and specialized applications (e.g. phone services).\n\nHybrid conceptual models are often employed, where different ways of carrying out the same actions is supported at the interface - but can take longer to learn.  \n\n\nInterface Metaphors\n\n\nInterface designed to be similar to a physical entity but also has own properties (e.g. desktop metaphor, web portals).\n\nCan be based on activity, object or a combination of both.\n\nExploit user\u2019s familiar knowledge, helping them to understand \u2018the unfamiliar\u2019.\n\nConjures up the essence of the unfamiliar activity, enabling users to leverage of this to understand more aspects of the unfamiliar functionality.  \n\n\nAdvantages\n\n\n\n\nMakes learning new systems easier\n\n\nHelps users understand the underlying conceptual model\n\n\nCan be very innovative and enable the realm of computers and their applications to be made more accessible\n\n\n\n\nDisadvantages\n\n\n\n\nBreak conventional and cultural rules (e.g. recycle bin placed on desktop)\n\n\nCan constrain designers in the way they conceptualize a problem space\n\n\nConflict with design principles\n\n\nForces users to only understand the system in terms of the metaphor\n\n\nDesigners can inadvertently use bad existing designs and transfer the bad parts over\n\n\nLimits designers\u2019 imagination in coming up with new conceptual models\n\n\n\n\nAssignments\n\n\nNone",

This main character has attitudes, motivations, goals, pain points, etc. Use multiple specific imaginary examples of real users of different types.\n\n\nScenarios:\n Defines where, when, and how the story of the persona takes place. The scenario is a narrative that describes how the persona behaves as a sequence of events.\n\n\nGoals:\n Defines what the persona wants or needs to fulfill. The goal is the motivation of of why the persona is taking actions. When that goal is reached, the scenario ends.  \n\n\nPersonas\n\n\nExample Persona 1:\n Mary is an 18 year old first year English major. She has limited computer experience, but regularly uses a PC to contact friends using email or Facebook. Mary reads many novels, often on the bus or in bed. She often writes notes in the margins. Although she really likes the format of paper books, Mary would like to use an eBook device because many digital books are free.\n\n\nExample Persona 2:\n Felix is 13 years old. He gets an allowance every week but spends it out with his friends, and there is usually not anything left over to bank. He often gets money from his grandparents and uncles for his birthday and this is always deposited to his account. He saves this for more expensive purchases; for example, he likes to buy video games. Plus he likes to buy trendy clothes. Felix\u2019s account allows him to withdraw small amounts of\nmoney from ATMs.\n\n\nTask analysis\n\n\nAn activity designers use to gain an understanding of what a system must do to support users in their goals and tasks using:oObservation, interviews, contextual inquiry, participatory design.\n\n\nCharacteristics:\n\n\n\n\nVariability from one time to the next Regularity\n\n\nKnowledge \n skills required Physical environment\n\n\nTime critical?\n\n\nSafety hazards\n\n\nAlone vs. group?\n\n\nOther simultaneous tasks\n\n\n\n\nHierarchical Task Analysis (HTA)\n\n\nBreak a task into smaller and smaller subtasks, until you reach the smallest unit of work\n\n\nNeed to ask questions:\n\n\n\n\nConsider writing letter example\n\n\nWhere is the task performed?\n\n\nHow often is it performed?\n\n\nWhat are its time and resource constraints? How is the task learned?\n\n\nWhat can go wrong?\n\n\nWho else is involved in the task?\n\n\nAlso important to consider sequences of tasks (may be different for same set of tasks)\n\n\n\n\nTask Scenario\n\n\n\n\nA personal narrative story identifying a task, with specific details\n\n\nMay make use of a persona\n\n\nOne specific task, not a whole series of tasks\n\n\nShows context of use\n\n\nUsually does not say anything about the system interface\n\n\n\n\nUse Case\n\n\nLike a scenario, but describes interface details and specific order to subtasks. Steps through a task for a given interface, can list all the alternate possibilities (alternate courses)\n\n\nUse case for shared calendar example\n\n\n\n\nThe user chooses the option to arrange a meeting. 2. The system prompts user for the attendees.\n\n\nThe user types in a list of names.\n\n\nThe system checks that the list is valid.\n\n\nThe system prompts the user for constraints. 6. The user types in meeting constraints.\n\n\nThe system searches the calendars for a date that satisfies the constraints.\n\n\nThe system displays a list of potential dates.\n\n\nThe user chooses one of the dates.\n\n\nThe system writes the meeting into the calendar.\n\n\nThe system emails all the meeting participants informing them of them appointment\n\n\n\n\nScenarios vs Use cases\n\n\n\n\nScenarios help before you start designing \n also for evaluation\n\n\nHelp you clearly define tasks, avoid making assumptions about how interface will operate\n\n\nEvaluate whether the interface will work for a particular user in a particular instance\n\n\nUse cases help once you have a design\n\n\nEvaluate whether a design will work for all possible cases (later: cognitive walk though technique)\n\n\n\n\nContextual Design\n\n\nAn approach for defining software and hardware systems that collects multiple customer-centered techniques into an integrated design process.
