#SENG 310 - Lecture 10

###15 February 2016

##Reading, speaking and listening

* The ease with which people an read, listen, or speak differs
* Many prefer listening to reading
* Reading can be quicker than speaking or listening
* Listening requires less cognitive effort than reading or speaking
* People with dyslexia have difficulties understanding and recognizing written words

###Design implications:

* Speech-based menus and instructions should be short
* Accentuate the intonation of artificially generated speech voices
* Provide opportunities for making text large or otherwise modify reading material

###Problem-solving planning, reasoning and decision-making

* All involve __reflective cognition__ (e.g. thinking about what to do, what the options are, and the consequences)
* Often involves conscious processes, discussion with others (or oneself), and the use of __artefacts__ (e.g. maps, books, pen and paper)
* May involve working through different scenarios and deciding which is the best options

###Design Implications

* Provide additional information/functions for users who wish to understand more about how to carry out an activity more effectively
* Use simple computational aids to support rapid decision-making and planning for users on the move

###Information Processing

Information in

1. Encoding
2. Comparison
3. Response selection
4. Response execution

output or response out

###Human processor model limitations

* Based on modelling mental activities that happen exclusively inside the head* Do not adequately account for how people interact with computers and other devices in real world

###Cognition in the wild

* Cognitive processes may be distributed across __members of a social group__* Cognitive processes may involve coordinationbetween __internal and external__ (material or environmental) structure* Process may be distributed through time â€“ with products of earlier events transforming nature of later events 

###Externalizing to reduce memory load

Diaries, reminders, calendars, notes, shopping lists, to-dos  
on Post-its, piles, marked emails

__External representations:__  

* Remind us that we need to do something
* Remind us of what to do
* Remind us when to do something

###Computational offloading

Using technology to compute information which could otherwise (with more difficulty) be computed by the human

###Annotation and cognitive tracing

__Annotation:__ e.g. cross off, ticking underlining  
__Cognitive Tracing:__ e.g. playing scrabble, playing with graphs

###Design implications

Provide external representations at the interface that reduce memory load and facilitate computational offloading
